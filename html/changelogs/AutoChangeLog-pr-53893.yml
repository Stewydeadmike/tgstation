  - rscadd: "You can now use the Activate Held Object and Drop Object hotkeys (default Z and Q, respectively) to activate arm-implanted tools and put objects away. You must have the hand free before you can activate it this way."
  - balance: "Arm implant tools are no longer no-drop, and instead simply snap back if they get dropped. Don't sweat it, if you slip just press Z again."
